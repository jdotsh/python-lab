# Introduction to Algorithms and Programming Lab @ AI Master

Introduction to Algorithms and Programming Laboratory, _A. A.2020-21_, **Artificial Intelligence Master Degree in
Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna**.

[Professor Simone Martini](http://cs.unibo.it/~martini) helds the course.

## Instructions to use this repository

There are two ways one can interact with this repo, you can download it as a `.zip` file or `clone` it as a `git` repository.

- In the first case, there is one drawback (otherwise they would not have invented `git`): **you would miss updateds**

If you are new to `git` AND you want to learn about it, please have a look [at this document](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/), it is a brief guide on the usage of `git` with a useful _cheatsheet_ that you can print and keep with you wherever you go

- If you know everything about `git` you don't need this guide. 

### Now that we have the code
You have 2 ways to interact with **Python Notebooks**

- First, you can download `jupyter notebook` from the web [everything that you need is here](https://jupyter.org/install) and use it!

- Second, you can _copy and paste_ the content of `code cells` into your favorite **IDE** and execute it as usual.
  
  - **GitHub** nicely provides you a viewer for `Python Notebooks` that ease the process of _copy/paste_ (otherwise it would be just an unreadable full-of-code meaningless page).
